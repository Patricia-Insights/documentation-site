*What is the performance of your infrastructure? What hotelier product is being requested and booked around the world? How well are you doing comparing to your competitors?*

**Knowledge is power** and that's what the product **Insights-X** offers, based on more than 2 billion search requests and more than 20,000 bookings per day.

In order to answer the three previous questions, the product has been designed in three parts, which we explain below:

## Performance
This first part answers the question of: **What is the performance of your infrastructure?** 
With it you will be able to know in detail the performance of your requests for searches, quotes, bookings and cancellations. You will know the status of your requests, what types of errors are you receiving, what times per request you're handling. Find out more about performance [here](/insights-x/datasets/dataset-content/performance/).

## Insights
This second part answers the question of: **What hotelier product is being requested and booked around the world?**
With it you will be able to know in detail the information of the requests of searches and the details of the bookings through TravelgateX, the global marketplace. Hotels, destinations, markets, prices are only  a part of the information that you will have with the product Insights-X.

## Benchmark
Finally, with a benchmark we offer you the **competitive advantage** of knowing **how well you are doing comparing to the competition**.
The comparisons are based on the number of available hotels, total bookings and net revenue, plus you will be able to see your position with respect to other competitors filtering at the level of country, city and clients/suppliers adding the possibility of fixing your comptetitive set.
